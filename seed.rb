# write a class that does the seeding with a seed method. e.g. class DbSeeds; def self.seed; DO IT; end; end;
#2.) run irb from your project root
#3.) require your 'root' file. e.g. MyApp.rb (i'm assuming this app is requiring all your models and everything.  If it isn't, require the file that does)
#4.) run the method that does the seeding in the seeds class.  e.g. DbSeeds.seed  (assuming seeds deletes the existing data first, if notâ€¦do that first)
